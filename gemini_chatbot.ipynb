It consists of hardware, which includes physical components like the processor, memory, and storage, and software, which comprises the instructions that tell the computer what to do. The processor, also known as the CPU, is the brain of the computer and executes the instructions. Memory, or RAM, temporarily stores data and instructions that are being processed, while storage devices such as hard disk drives or solid-state drives permanently store data and programs. Input devices like keyboards and mice allow users to interact with the computer, while output devices like monitors and printers display or print the results of computations or other operations.\\n\\nIn summary, a computer is a programmable machine that can store, process, and output data and information under the control of a set of instructions.\"\n",
